# Gemini CLI Interaction Summary

This document summarizes the interactions with the Gemini CLI for the Proxmox-terraform project.

## Code Review and Refactoring

The session began with a request to review the Terraform code in the repository. The following observations were made:

*   Redundant VM configurations in `locals.tf` and `variables.tf`.
*   Insecure TLS setting in `provider.tf`.
*   Unclear `for_each` loop in `main.tf`.
*   Minimal information in `output.tf`.
*   Basic `README.md`.

Based on the review, the following refactoring tasks were performed:

1.  **Consolidated VM Configurations:** Deleted the `locals.tf` file to use `variables.tf` as the single source of truth.
2.  **Improved Security:** Removed the `pm_tls_insecure = true` setting from `provider.tf`.
3.  **Refactored `main.tf`:**
    *   Updated the `for_each` loop to be keyed by the VM name for more robust and predictable behavior.
    *   Added the `tags` attribute to the `proxmox_vm_qemu` resource.
    *   Made the network `tag` attribute optional using the `try()` function to prevent errors when it's not defined in `variables.tf`.
4.  **Enhanced Outputs:** Updated `output.tf` to provide more detailed information about the created virtual machines, including their IDs, names, tags, and network configurations.
5.  **Updated Documentation:** Updated the `README.md` file with a more detailed project description and a "Usage" section.

## Gitignore and Sensitive Information

1.  **Updated `.gitignore`:** Added more patterns to the `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information (like private keys and credential files) and common editor directories from being committed to the repository.
2.  **Created `terraform.tfvars`:** Created a `terraform.tfvars` file to store sensitive provider credentials. This file is ignored by `.gitignore`.
